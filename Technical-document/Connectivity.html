        <h1>Connectivity</h1>
        <h2>Mobile App</h2>
        <h4>To Use The Mobile App</h4>
        <p>To set up the Tesla mobile app to communicate with your Model S:</p>

        <ol class="list">
            <li>Download the Tesla mobile app to your phone.</li>
            <li>Log in to the Tesla mobile app by entering your Tesla account credentials.</li>
            <li>Enable mobile access to your Model S by touching Controls > Safety > Allow Mobile Access.</li>   
        </ol>

        <p>Your phone and vehicle must both be actively connected to cellular service to allow the mobile app to communicate with your vehicle. Tesla recommends that you always have a functional physical key readily available 
            if parking in an area with limited or absent cellular service, such as an indoor parking garage. </p>

        <h2>WIFI</h2>

        <p>Wi-Fi is available as a data connection method and is often faster than cellular data networks. Connecting to Wi-Fi is especially useful in areas with limited or no cellular connectivity. 
            To ensure fast, reliable delivery of software and map updates, Tesla recommends leaving Model S connected to a Wi-Fi network whenever possible (for example, when parked overnight).</p>

        <p>To connect to a Wi-Fi network:</p>

        <ol class="list">
            <li>Touch Controls > Wi-Fi icon at the top of the Controls screen. Model S begins to scan and display detected Wi-Fi networks that are within range.</li>
            <li>Select the Wi-Fi network you want to use, enter the password (if necessary), then touch Confirm.</li>
            <li>Model S connects to the Wi-Fi network. Whenever the network is within range, Model S connects to it automatically.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>You can also connect to a hidden network that isn't shown on the list of scanned networks. Just touch Wi-Fi Settings, enter the name of the network in 
            the resulting dialog box, select the security setting, then touch Add Network.</p>
        
        <h2>Bluetooth</h2>

        <p>Before using your phone or other Bluetooth device with Model S, you must pair it. Pairing sets up Model S to communicate with supported Bluetooth-capable devices. You can pair up to ten Bluetooth phones. 
            Unless you've specified a specific phone as a Priority Device, or if the phone specified as Priority Device is not within range, Model S always connects to the last phone that was used (provided it is within range). 
            To connect to a different phone, see Connecting to a Paired Device.</p>

        <h4>Pairing a bluetooth device</h4>

        <p>Pairing allows you to use your Bluetooth-capable phone hands-free to make and receive phone calls, access your contact list, recent calls, etc. It also allows you to play media files from your phone. Once a phone 
            is paired, Model S can connect to it whenever the phone is within range.</p>

        <p>To pair a phone, follow these steps while sitting inside Model S:</p>

        <ol class="list">
            <li>Ensure both the touchscreen and the phone are powered on.</li>
            <li>On your phone, enable Bluetooth and ensure it is discoverable.</li>
        </ol>
