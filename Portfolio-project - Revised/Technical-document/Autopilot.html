        <h2>About Autopilot</h2>
        <p>Autopilot is a suite of advanced driver assistance features that are intended to make driving safer and less stressful. None of these features make Model S fully autonomous or replace you as the driver. 
            Autopilot features come standard with all new Tesla vehicles.</p>
        
        <p>Basic Autopilot includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Maintains your speed and an adjustable following distance from the vehicle in front of you, if there is one (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control).</li>
            <li>Autosteer: Maintains your speed and distance from a leading vehicle while also intelligently keeping Model S in its lane (see Autosteer).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Enhanced Autopilot includes additional features. Enhanced Autopilot Features are designed to further reduce driver workload and make common actions, such as changing lanes or parking, easier. </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Auto Lane Change: Moves Model S into an adjacent lane when you engage the turn signal and Autosteer is active (see Auto Lane Change).</li>
            <li>Navigate on Autopilot: Actively guides Model S from a highways on-ramp to off-ramp, including performing lane changes, navigating interchanges, automatically engaging the turn signal, 
                and taking the correct exit (see Navigate on Autopilot).</li>
            <li>Autopark: Parks Model S, either parallel or perpendicularly (see Autopark).</li>
            <li>Summon: Moves Model S forward or backward, even while youâ€™re outside the vehicle. This is useful for parking in tight parking spots (see Summon).</li>
            <li>Smart Summon: Moves Model S out of a parking space and through more complex environments, maneuvering around obstacles and other vehicles, to meet you or go to a predetermined target (see Smart Summon).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Autopilot features</h4>

        <p>This topic describes how to enable and use the following driver assistance features.</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Like traditional cruise control, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control maintains a set driving speed. However, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control also slows down or accelerates 
                Model S as needed to maintain the following distance from the vehicle in front of you. While Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is engaged, you are still responsible for steering Model S (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control).</li>
            <li>Autosteer: Like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer maintains a set speed (if there is not a vehicle in front of you) or a set following distance (if there is a vehicle in front of you). In addition, 
                Autosteer detects lane markings, road edges, and the presence of vehicles and objects to intelligently keep Model S in its driving lane (see Autosteer).</li>
            <li>Auto Lane Change: When you engage a turn signal while Autosteer is active, Auto Lane Change moves Model S into the adjacent lane in the direction indicated by the turn signal (see Auto Lane Change).</li>
            <li>Navigate on Autopilot: Navigate on Autopilot builds on the features of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer. While Autosteer is active, Navigate on Autopilot allows Model S to suggest and, if configured, 
                automatically change lanes to pass other vehicles and follow the navigation route (see Navigate on Autopilot).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer use information from the cameras on Model S to detect lane markings, road edges, and other vehicles and road users around Model S.</p>
