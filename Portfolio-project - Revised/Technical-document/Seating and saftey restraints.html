        <h1>Seating and Safety Restraints</h1>
        <h2>Front and Rear Seats</h2>
        <h4>Correct Driving Position</h4>
        <p>The seat, head support, seat belt and airbags work together to maximize your safety. Using these correctly ensures greater protection.</p>

        <img src="safety1.png" class="safety-pic" class="pic-all">

        <p>Position the seat so you can wear the seat belt correctly, while being as far away from the front airbag as possible:</p>

        <ol class="list">
            <li>Sit upright with both feet on the floor and the seat back in an upright position.</li>
            <li>Make sure you can easily reach the pedals and that your arms are slightly bent when holding 
                the steering yoke (or steering wheel). Your chest should be at least 10 inches (25 cm) from the center of the airbag cover.</li>
            <li>Place the shoulder section of the seat belt mid-way between your neck and your shoulder. Fit the lap section of the belt tightly 
                across your hips, not across your stomach.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Seat Belts</h2>
        <h4>Wearing Seat Belts</h4>
        <p>Using seat belts and child safety seats is the most effective way to protect occupants if a collision occurs. Therefore, wearing a seat belt is required by law in most jurisdictions. All seats \
           are equipped with three-point inertia reel seat belts. Inertia reel belts are automatically tensioned to allow occupants to move comfortably during normal driving conditions. To securely hold child 
           safety seats, all passenger seating positions are equipped with an automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature that, by fully extracting the seat belt (beyond the length needed for a typical adult occupant), 
           locks the belt into place until the seat belt is unbuckled (see Installing Seat Belt Retained Child Seats). The seat belt reel automatically locks to prevent movement of occupants if Model S experiences a force 
           associated with hard acceleration, braking, cornering, or an impact in a collision.
            </p>

        <h4>Seat Belt Reminders</h4>

        <p>You can temporarily disable a seat belt reminder associated with a rear seating position. This is useful when you are carrying an object in a rear seat that triggers the seat belt reminder alert. To disable the 
            reminder, touch the associated seat on the seat belt reminder popup message that displays on the touchscreen when a seat belt reminder is active. When a reminder is disabled, the seat belt reminder icon is replaced 
            by a seat icon, for the current drive only. Touch the seat again to re-enable the reminder.</p>
